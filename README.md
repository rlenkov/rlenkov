# Welcome!

**Hi, I'm Richard! A proactive, and constantly curious techie, and creative mind**. I enjoy fiddling with code and writing stories.

I have always been a bold and diligent fellow who loves to create progressive change and shake things up. I spent some time as a physics major, traveler, and bartender before I ended up in IT.

Currently, I'm developing *infrastructure for cloud-native products* in the telecommunications industry. I'm kind of a **jack of all trades**, usually involved in all parts of the development lifecycle. I also do/did some web development as a side hustle.

**Here are some keywords that describe what I do:**
> python, bash, javascript, typescript, react, groovy, erlang, Java, perl, Apache Ant, bazel, make, cmake, CI, CD, API, Jenkins, Pipeline, Job-Dsl, Spinnaker, Ansible, Kubernetes, Helm, Docker, woodwork, masonry, printer support, dog whispering, fantasy writing, hotel catering, dnd dm duty, cigar connoisseur, etc.
